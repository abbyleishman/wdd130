      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I like plants. Everyone likes plants. Do you like plants? Think about the last time you bought plants from the store. Was it overwhelming? Did they provide you with enough information? Were your hands full? That is what my website does. It provides clear instructions and plant information so you can be successful with any plant you buy. It eliminates the cumbersome aspect of carrying plants around the store and loading them into your car and into your home. I make life easier for plant lovers and plant buyers. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is men and women who are interested in learning more about plants. There is no age that the site is limited to, but the aesthetics are geared towards millennials and Gen Z. I want people to feel like this is a trustworthy site with helpful information. I will use calm, natural colors to help emphasize this idea. The natural colors will also go with the website topic of plants. The text will also be mild. </p>  <!-- change this -->
