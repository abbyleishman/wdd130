    <h2>Abby Leishman</h2>
    <p> Hi everyone! My name is Abby Leishman. This is my 8th semester here
        at BYUI. I am a Web Design and Development major, but I was a little
        late to the major switch. I am originally from Southern California,
        just 30 miles north of Los Angeles. I currently live in Rexburg with my husband.
        We got married 9 months ago in the Newport Beach Temple. 
    </p>
    <p>I work as a graphic designer here in town, so free time is sparce,
        but if I do have free time I like to spend time outdoors! My favorites
        are hiking and snowboarding. I also have lots of house plants that 
        have become a hobby to collect and take care of. 
    </p>
